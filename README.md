# prog²
_Because Metaprogramming is just programming squared_

prog² (or just prog2) is a small parser library and data description format in
a similar manner to python dictionaries.

## Inspiration
The project is inspired by Ryan Fleury's [metadesk](https://github.com/ryanfleury/metadesk)
albeit with quite different design styles. prog2 does not try to be a superset
of JSON and is written with stricter expression evaluation rules.
